# Project Blueprint: Firebase Studio Web Project

## Overview
This project is a simple web application hosted within Firebase Studio, adhering to modern web standards (Baseline) for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create responsive, maintainable, and visually appealing web experiences without external frameworks, leveraging Web Components for reusability, modern CSS for styling, and ES Modules for JavaScript.

## Detailed Outline of Features, Styling, and Design

### Initial Setup
- **HTML:** Basic `index.html` structure with a title, a heading, and a placeholder button. Links to `style.css` and `main.js`.
- **CSS:** `style.css` is currently empty, ready for modern CSS features.
- **JavaScript:** `main.js` is currently empty, ready for ES Modules and modern JS syntax.

### Current Features
- **Hello World Page:** A simple page displaying "Hello, world!" with a button for demonstration.

### Implemented Features
- **Affiliate Inquiry Form (Formspree Integration):**
  - Integrated a contact form into `index.html` for affiliate inquiries.
  - The form includes fields for 'Name', 'Email', and 'Message'.
  - Utilizes Formspree for backend form submission, with the action set to `https://formspree.io/f/mkozglad`.
  - Semantic HTML5 elements (`<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`) are used for structure and accessibility.
- **Modern CSS Styling:**
  - Applied foundational styling to `body`, `header`, and `main` for a clean, modern look.
  - Form elements (`.form-container`, `form`, `.form-group`, `label`, `input`, `textarea`, `button`) are styled for visual appeal and usability.
  - Implemented responsive design using `@media` queries to ensure optimal display on various screen sizes (e.g., smaller margins, padding, and font sizes on screens less than 600px wide).
  - Focus styles are provided for input fields for enhanced user experience.
  - Button includes hover effects for interactivity.
